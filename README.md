# ShitShare
A dumb sharing site for photos and videos, made by me, using a bit of borrowed code.

## Information
* This was made on Windows, so when video upload support comes you might need to modify ffmpeg code.
* To create a local instance of ShitShare, just modify the database settings on functions.php and import the SQL.
* Most of the stuff on the site as of now is a big placeholder. If you're gonna contribute with assets, code improvements and more, feel free to submit a PR

## To-do List
* Fix logout
* Add image and video support
* Add profile editor as well as CSS support
* Add a footer
